This project is developed on behalf of [Humans Of Vo Thi Sau](https://humansofvothisau.com "Humans Of Vo Thi Sau"). Our aim is to create a website that provide the students information about the National High School Graduation Exam.
The website is built on [React](https://reactjs.org/ "React") with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/ "TypeScript") and with the UI supported by [Ant Design](https://ant.design/ "Ant Design").
## Current Features
See the latest release version and more details in release notes at [Release page](https://github.com/humansofvothisau/university.webapp/releases "Release page").
With the current release, the students can:
- Know how many days until the exam day.
- Search for the benchmark for more than 500 universities and colleges in Vietnam.
- Look up their exam mark based on their exam identification number (for the current year only).
## Planned Features
In the future release, we are planned to improve the website to be available for:
- Using our own database instead of retrieving directly from other websites.
- Searching the subjects that are in a subject block.
- Providing the students with a diverse database of exam review questions and tests.
- Providing a console / webpage for Admin.
